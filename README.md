# Kata Collection

## Introduction

Hello to my Kata Collection,

the purpose of this repro is to collect any idea of katas or small problems, which can be solved with the respective programming language.

These katas are either newly created or a based on already existing katas and can be used to hone the skills to solve problems, or just practis some concepts.

It's quite a spontaniouse idee, and the design will most likly change in the coming time.
